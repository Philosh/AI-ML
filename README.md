A project which uses various AI/ML algorithms for data classfication, prediction and creating language models.


So far, there is 
1) `Cat and Dog Classifier` uses Convolutional Neural Networks to classify Cats vs Dogs' images using deep computer vision techniques.

2) `Natural Language Processor` which predicts `Good / Bad` sentiments of a review using RNN and Generates plays using a training data set and LSTM

3) `1 Reinforcement Learning` which navigates a virtual lake and goes to a target without stepping in an invalid space. This is implemented using Q tables enforecement.
